Node.js and npm:
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from the official website: Node.js.

Create a Next.js App:
Use the following commands to create a new Next.js app:

bash
Copy code
npx create-next-app your-app-name
cd your-app-name
Install Dependencies:
Install necessary dependencies such as jsonwebtoken for JWT and any RBAC-related packages you plan to use. For example:

bash
Copy code
npm install jsonwebtoken your-rbac-package
Implement JWT Authentication:
Set up JWT authentication in your Next.js app. This involves creating middleware to handle authentication and protecting routes that require authentication.

Implement RBAC:
Design and implement RBAC functionality in your backend. Define roles and permissions, and create middleware to check if a user has the necessary permissions.

Database Setup (if required):
If your application involves data storage, set up a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.) and integrate it into your Next.js app.

Create API Endpoints:
Create API endpoints for user registration, login, and any other functionality required for RBAC. Implement the necessary logic to handle user roles and permissions.

Testing:
Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure that the authentication and RBAC functionality is working as expected.

Run the Application:
Start your Next.js app locally to test everything:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Backend Developer Interview Task - RBAC with JWT Authentication in Next.js:
The backend developer interview task could include the following requirements:

User Registration and Authentication:
Implement user registration and authentication using JWT. Users should be able to sign up, log in, and receive a JWT token upon successful authentication.

RBAC Implementation:
Define at least two roles (e.g., "admin" and "user") with different permissions. Implement RBAC middleware to check if a user has the necessary permissions to access certain routes or perform specific actions.

Protected Routes:
Design a few routes that require authentication and specific roles or permissions to access. Ensure that unauthorized users are properly restricted.

Token Refresh Mechanism:
Implement a token refresh mechanism to allow users to obtain a new JWT token without having to log in again.

Logging and Error Handling:
Implement logging for important actions and error handling for potential issues in the authentication and RBAC processes.

Documentation:
Provide clear documentation on how to set up the development environment, explanations of the implemented RBAC and authentication mechanisms, and instructions for testing the application.

The goal of the task is to assess the candidate's ability to design and implement secure authentication and authorization systems, as well as their understanding of backend development concepts in the context of a Next.js application. It also evaluates their ability to write clean and maintainable code, handle errors, and document their work effectively.
